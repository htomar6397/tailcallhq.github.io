### Guide to Adding Custom Scalar Support in Tailcall

Tailcall empowers you to define and utilize custom scalar types within your GraphQL schemas, enabling tailored data validation for specific data formats. This guide will walk you through adding support for custom scalars like Email, PhoneNumber, Date, and Url in your Tailcall project.

## 1. Define Custom Scalar Types in Your Schema

Custom scalar types serve as the building blocks for defining specialized data formats in your GraphQL schema. When defining custom scalar types, it's essential to choose descriptive names that reflect their purpose and semantics. Here's how you can define custom scalar types in your schema:

```graphql
scalar Email
scalar PhoneNumber
scalar Date
scalar Url
```

## 2. Implement Resolvers for Custom Scalars

Once you've defined your custom scalar types in the schema, the next step is to implement resolvers for each custom scalar on the server-side. Resolvers are responsible for handling data validation, conversion, and coercion according to the defined scalar type. Here's how you can implement resolvers for custom scalars in your server-side code:

```graphql
type Query {
  email(value: Email!): Email! @const(data: "{{args.value}}")
  phone(value: PhoneNumber!): PhoneNumber! @const(data: "{{args.value}}")
  date(value: Date!): Date! @const(data: "{{args.value}}")
  url(value: Url!): Url! @const(data: "{{args.value}}")
}
```

In the above example, each resolver function takes an input argument of the corresponding custom scalar type and returns the same scalar type after validation and conversion.

## 3. Craft Validation Logic within Resolvers

Validation logic within custom scalar resolvers ensures that incoming data adheres to the defined data format and constraints. Depending on the nature of the custom scalar type, validation logic may involve checks for format compliance, range validation, or semantic validation. Here's an example of validation logic for the `email` scalar resolver:

```javascript
// Inside the email resolver (replace with actual validation logic)
function validateEmail(email) {
  const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
  return emailRegex.test(email);
}

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    email(parent, args) {
      if (!validateEmail(args.value)) {
        throw new Error('Invalid email format');
      }
      // Proceed with processing the valid email
      return args.value;
    },
    // ... other resolvers
  }
};
```

In this example, the `validateEmail` function checks whether the input value conforms to the standard email format using a regular expression. If the validation fails, an error is thrown, indicating that the email format is invalid.

## 4. Thorough Testing of Custom Scalars

Comprehensive testing of custom scalar resolvers is crucial to ensure the correctness and robustness of your GraphQL API. Test cases should cover both valid and invalid input values, as well as edge cases and boundary conditions. Here are examples of test cases for the `email` scalar resolver:

```graphql
# Valid email address
mutation {
  createUser(email: "valid@email.com") {
    # ...
  }
}

# Invalid email address
mutation {
  createUser(email: "invalid_email") {
    # ... (should throw an error)
  }
}
```

By testing various input values, you can verify that your custom scalar resolvers handle different scenarios correctly and provide appropriate error messages for invalid data.

## 5. Handling Unsupported Scalars

In cases where Tailcall does not natively support certain scalar types, it's essential to advocate for adding support for those scalars. Consider creating an issue or feature request on the Tailcall GitHub repository, providing clear documentation and use cases to justify the need for adding support for those scalars.

## Additional Considerations:

- # Performance Optimization:
 Optimize the performance of custom scalar resolvers by minimizing unnecessary computations and leveraging efficient validation techniques.
- # Error Handling:
 Implement robust error handling mechanisms within your resolvers to gracefully manage situations where validation fails or unexpected errors occur during data processing.
- # Custom Type Libraries:
 Explore existing libraries or frameworks in your chosen programming language that might provide pre-built custom scalar types or utilities to streamline the implementation process.

## Conclusion

By incorporating custom scalar support in Tailcall, you extend the capabilities of your GraphQL schemas, enabling precise data validation and enforcement of specific data formats. This guide provides a comprehensive framework for adding custom scalars to your Tailcall project, ensuring the integrity and reliability of your GraphQL API.

Remember to tailor the validation logic within the resolvers to match your specific data requirements and consider contributing to the Tailcall project by advocating for the addition of support for unsupported scalar types.
